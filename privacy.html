<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>8.2.</strong> In certain cases, you may have a right to restrict processing of your Personal Data (so we only process your Personal Data in limited circumstances, including with your consent) or to object to processing of your Personal Data (so we no longer process your Personal Data). These rights can be exercised by contacting us via email.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>8.3.</strong> In cases where processing of Personal Data is based on your consent, you have the right to refuse and revoke consent to the processing of your Personal Data by contacting us via email.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>8.5.</strong> You can use the right to lodge a complaint with your supervisory authority if, despite our commitment and efforts to protect your Personal Data, you believe your data protection rights have been infringed. The complaint can be lodged in the Member State where you live, work or where you assume the alleged violation took place.</p>
